Holberton School - Functions and Nested Loops

Description

This project covers fundamental C programming concepts, focusing on:

Nested loops

Functions

Function prototypes

Variable scope

GCC compilation flags

Header files

Each task in this project involves implementing specific C functions following Holberton's guidelines, including the use of the Betty coding style.

Requirements

Code must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the flags:

-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

No use of global variables.

No more than 5 functions per file.

_putchar is allowed, but no standard C library functions (e.g., printf, puts).

All function prototypes must be included in main.h.

Each file must end with a new line.

The Betty style must be followed.

Tasks

0. _putchar

File: 0-putchar.c
Description: Prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
Return: 0 on success.

1. Print Alphabet

File: 1-alphabet.c
Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
Description: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Constraints: _putchar can only be used twice.

2. Print Alphabet x10

File: 2-print_alphabet_x10.c
Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
Description: Prints the alphabet 10 times, each on a new line.
Constraints: _putchar can only be used twice.

3. islower

File: 3-islower.c
Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Description: Checks if a character is lowercase.
Return: 1 if c is lowercase, 0 otherwise.

4. isalpha

File: 4-isalpha.c
Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Description: Checks if a character is alphabetic (uppercase or lowercase).
Return: 1 if c is a letter, 0 otherwise.

5. Print Sign

File: 5-sign.c
Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Description: Prints the sign of a number.
Return:

1 and prints + if n is positive.

0 and prints 0 if n is zero.

-1 and prints - if n is negative.

6. Absolute Value

File: 6-abs.c
Prototype: int _abs(int);
Description: Computes the absolute value of an integer.

7. Print Last Digit

File: 7-print_last_digit.c
Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
Description: Prints the last digit of a number.
Return: The value of the last digit.

8. Jack Bauer

File: 8-24_hours.c
Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
Description: Prints every minute of the day, from 00:00 to 23:59.

9. Times Table

File: 9-times_table.c
Prototype: void times_table(void);
Description: Prints the 9 times table starting with 0.

10. Add Two Numbers

File: 10-add.c
Prototype: int add(int, int);
Description: Adds two integers and returns the result.

11. Print to 98

File: 11-print_to_98.c
Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
Description: Prints all natural numbers from n to 98, in order.
